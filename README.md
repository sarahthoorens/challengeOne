## Description

This is an HTML and CSS coding challenge to update existing code to improve accessibility and optimize SEO. The information provided for this challenge is as follows:

  ## User Story
```
  AS A marketing agency
  I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
  SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

  ## Acceptance Criteria
```
  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  WHEN I view the icon and image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Purpose

Creating an accessible website using semantic HTML elements provides a comfortable user experience for all users. For users requiring an assistive reading device to read websites, an accessible site makes it simpler to navigate and ensures they will have access to and understanding of each element of the website. 

Converting to a semantic website also improves SEO as it provides for a more digestible content for search engines.
